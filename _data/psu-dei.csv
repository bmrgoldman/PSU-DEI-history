Such recommendations would become part of the resources to be used by President Jordan for his report on the matter of investment divestiture of companies doing business in South Africa to the Board of Trustees of the University on January 17, 1986. The committee first convened on December 13, 1985 and meet subsequently on December 19, 1985 and on January 6 and January 7, 1986. The preparation of this report was constrained by a request that the Committee complete its work by January 9, 1986. Members of the Committee prepared various portions of the draft material incorporated in this report. The committee's work was aided by the Office of the Treasurer of the University which provided voluminous background materials; its work was also informed by actions taken during the 1985 Fall Semester by the Council of Commonwealth Student Governments, the Undergraduate Student Government, the Graduate Student Association, and the University Faculty Senate.
